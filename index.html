      <p>*Eligibility for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC) and cost-sharing reductions is based on annual federal income thresholds, household size, and plan availability within the applicable service area. If enhanced tax subsidies enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are unavailable, premium tax credit amounts may be reduced. For plan year 2026, eligible enrollees may have access to ACA coverage at or below $50 after the APTC is applied, subject to federal eligibility determinations. Premium rates, plan availability, and subsidy amounts vary by state and marketplace. Final eligibility and premium obligations are determined by the Health Insurance Marketplace under Internal Revenue Code §36B and applicable federal regulations. “Plan Year 2026 Marketplace Plans and Prices Fact Sheet.” <a href="#"> CMS.gov</a> , October 28, 2025.</p>
